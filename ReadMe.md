## IMPORTANT:

This is an NEW Firearms Modlet. It will NOT work along side the old, or update the old. Suggested that you start fresh. If you choose to update Firearms 1, to this modlet, please insure that ALL existing Firearms assets (guns, ammo, etc) are removed BEFORE you update/install new. There are changes to the progression files within this Modlet. Player Saved Data WILL BE WIPED. Sadly, there is nothing I can do about this, as it's TFP's core files that effects this.

## Requirements:

Requires Alpha 17 version of 7 Days to Die. Will not work on A16.4 or lesser.
Suggested for minigun that you have decent framerates. Pixle textures on fire may cause FPS drops in lower end clients.
Some guns will skip your game upon loading in the hotbar. Their file size is quite large. Fix coming soon hopefully.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Update: 4/7/19 
1.05
Updates:
- Big change to how guns are learned for further crafting
- Firearms can now be found in Schematic Books, which can be used to learn how to craft each individual weapon. This bypasses Progression Level requirements for individual weapons.
- Ammo can now be found in Schematic Books as well. Ammo and Firearms are NOT unlocked together, like they are in progression.
- Progression is still existing. This method is used to unlock full groups of weapons, and their respective ammo type.
- Schematics can also be crafted at the new Research Table ![Image](https://i.imgur.com/dkL8tOR.png)
- Guns will require: One Firearm, 10-200 Scrap Firearms, and 10 Paper.
- Ammo will require: One Round of specific ammo, 10-200 Scrap Ammo, 10 Paper.
- After learning the blueprint, you may craft the item at the correct Workbench. Workbenches still require point investment to unlock. New Research table is level 3. Scope Mods still require investment.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## About:

Welcome to the new and VASTLY improved Firearms! 
This Modlet will give you full access to 50 custom Firearms, complete with animations, audio, full gun modification (vanilla and modded), custom sound, custom ammo, the Total Package!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



# Crafting:

![Image](https://i.imgur.com/BcMR19Y.png) ![Image](https://i.imgur.com/9bvx2G5.png)
Crafting has changed in Firearms. It is now centralized entirely around 2 main Workbenches. Gun Workbench, and Ammo Workbench. 
Inside, you will find the first category containing ALL the ammo and guns. Then each class of Gun and Ammo inside it's own category (Pistols, SMG, Shotguns, Rifles, Large Weapons, Special, Mods)

![Image](https://i.imgur.com/WwTHrHE.png) The Ammo Bench , is very special. The last 2 categories contain Ammo, and Firearms Recycling. 
Here, you can turn all your unwanted guns and ammo, back into highly valued parts to craft the items of your choosing. You may also CRAFT (not scrap) these while on-the-go, to help with inventory control, but the value is much greater at a Workbench.

## Items you may receive from Scrap Ammo: ![Image](https://i.imgur.com/Z29PR5d.png)
- 1 Bullet Tip
- 1 Brass Casing
- 1 Steel Casing
- 3 Gun Powder
- 1 Buckshot
- 1 Rocket Tip (per 10)
- 1 Rocket Casing (per 10)

## Items you may receive from Firearms Recycling: ![Image](https://i.imgur.com/f5RJJOq.png)
- 50 Scrap Iron
- 25 Forged Iron
- 10 Forged Steel
- 2 Mechanical Parts 
- 5 Scrap Polymers
- 1 Military Fiber
- 2 Duct Tape 
- 1 Spring

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

![Image](https://i.imgur.com/Aj0gBWA.png)
Standard Holo Scope, comes in only Red (for now)

All mods can be crafted after obtaining the respective schematic, at the Gun Workshop 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------





# AMMO: 

![Image](https://i.imgur.com/9nwjRsP.png) ![Image](https://i.imgur.com/FiVXzO6.png) ![Image](https://i.imgur.com/qf7v5BV.png)
Ammo got a lot of loving! Completely redone icons, making it far easier for everyone to see what goes with what. Ontop of that, I opened up the guns to FAR more ammo options: 

There are now several options for your shooting pleasure. And even new Elemental Ammo :)
Elemental Ammo is expensive, but worth it. Explosive Rounds pack quite a punch, where as corrosive rounds while slowly eat away at a target, and incendiary to ignite your enemies ablaze! All of these 3 ammo types, work in all weapons.
For Shotguns, we have Dragonsbreath (Incendiary shotgun version) and Electric Shells!
Thankyou JaxTeller for the amazing idea of Dragonsbreath. It's truly an amazing thing to have in my mod! Thankyou :)


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# PROGRESSION: 

Everything is now in its own attribute location. This will make for some exciting updates, chalk full of great skills to compliment your Firearms. With that, will come various challenges and tasks to obtain skillpoints to invest.

Our attribute section will be identified by a Revolver Icon, located at the end of all your perks. From there, we can unlock everything we need to get started on our journey! Because there are so many sections to purchase, the costs are very low (1 point) until the final perk, with the Chaingun and Golden Gun, that will cost 5.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


## Animations: 

All guns have atleast a casing ejection animations when shooting. Most are fully animated, reloads and all.
This was all done by hand, without using scripting. It will take time for me to perfect every last gun. Some things might be off, some timers are a bit screwy. 

## Localization:

This mod pack now has Localization Files. This means, that there will be descriptive text in the Information Windows. What ammo goes to what, would be the most prominent feature of Localization, but this has allowed me to properly redo this ENTIRE modlet. Now, if you just drag and drop like normal, all you will see is a bunch of mayicgunMrad, mayicgunChaingun. etc. 
RussianDood has created an amazing program, to take the hassle out of the complexity behind adding Localization for some of us out there. No one wants to do the leg work of copying one file, finding the original, pasting it, then updating it everytime TFP does. No, Thanks to RussianDood, we have this amazing program to do the leg work for us. Inside this Modlet, you will find a Localization.bat file. After you place the Modlet into the correct location, just simply run the bat file (double click), and hit Enter, Pick whatever option you'd like (I suggest 1), Enter, enter again, and we are DONE! Thats it. You will only need to do this again when the Modlet updates and you download a new version. Other then that, you are free to boot up completely as normal everytime! No need to constantly run the file before you boot the game. 
Thankyou RussianDood!

# Updating Existing Worlds with old versions of Firearms: 


It is entirely possible to play your OLD WORLD. The only thing you will lose, is your players current level and skills. Now, important steps if you are going to UPDATE the old Firearms Modlet:
- Remove ALL Firearms related assets (guns, ammo, targets) from your world. Despawn them, do not just put them in a chest.
- Remove all belongings to your character, put them in a secure place in your home
- Remove the old Firearms Modlet, place new one in your Mods folder
- Load back into the game. You will most likely be a fresh spawn out in the wild. No worries. Hit F1. Type 
- giveselfxp 10000
- hit enter.

This will give you 1 level. Each level is roughly 10-20% more xp (not sure on exact values) then the one before it. So level 2, would be around 22,000, rather then 20,000. Adjust accordingly to regain your old levels back. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Changes:

- Fully animated most of the weapons, every gun atleast has shell expenditure. Most have reload/recoil animations.
- Redid all item and ammo icons, making them far easier to read
- Added all items to Gun Workshop, and Ammo Workshop for easier crafting and sorting
- Added Scrap Guns, to compliment Scram Ammo Concept (details below)
- Added new sound
- Applied ALL gun modifications to (nearly) all the guns. Items such as the Luger, and M82 50 Cal, remain the same. Everything else has been vastly expanded, and custom tuned to fit all gun mods.
- Opened up all guns to multiple ammo types. Up to 9 ammo selections per weapons
- Added Elemental Ammo (details below)
- Rebalanced trader, customized trade UI window to work with mod
- Added new ammo types


## Known bugs:

- Animations run off a bool call (not using scripting). They are all on timers. Sometimes, skills such as faster reloads, might make the animation go fast or slow in accordance with hand movement. I attuned the speeds based on the guns "unlock" level. Finding a M98 early game, might show a slower animation. This will fix itself as you get near the appropriate level
- Audio might be too high, or too low. Currently in the process of adjusting levels. Feedback would be amazing. I am hard of hearing myself, too many guns IRL :P Nothing legally disabling me. Just god awful range in volume/pitch.
- AR15 has crappy scopes. Need to break the model apart in 3ds. Will be patched eventually
- Explosive Ammo has no physical graphical effect

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## How to install
 
- Navagate to your 7 Days to Die Directory (default: C:/ProgramFiles86/Steam/Steamapps/Common/7DaystoDie)
- Right click anywhere in your MAIN directory (not Data/Configs, not 7DaysToDie_Data), and create New Folder 
- Name New Folder: Mods [Our directory should look similar to something like this](https://imgur.com/a/pm5sJKc)
- Download entire mod pack via GitHub or other Trusted source (I only share via Discord, and GitHub. For my personal mods, do not trust any other source unless verified by me)
- Drag and Drop Firearms modlet into 7 Days To Die/Mods folder. [Our modlet named "Firearms" should show up under the mods directory like so](https://imgur.com/a/YtYmNW3)
- To confirm proper boot, upon loading into a map/server, press F1, and you should see our mod load with the following line: 
`2018-12-28T22:36:15 2.709 INF [MODS] Trying to load from Firearms`
`2018-12-28T22:36:15 2.709 INF [MODS] Loaded Mod: Firearms (1.0)`
