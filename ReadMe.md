## For all Information, please go directly to the new Wiki:
* https://github.com/Jayick/Firearms2/wiki

## Requirements:

Requires Alpha 17 version of 7 Days to Die. Will not work on A16.4 or lesser.
Suggested for minigun that you have decent framerates. Pixle textures on fire may cause FPS drops in lower end clients.
Some guns will skip your game upon loading in the hotbar. Their file size is quite large. Fix coming soon hopefully.

Required to run Localization.bat file BEFORE launching mod. This will import all the names and descriptions for you, otherwise you will see every item start with "mayicgun...,mayicammo...,mayicblock..." 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## About:

Welcome to the new and VASTLY improved Firearms! 
This Modlet will give you full access to 50 custom Firearms, complete with animations, audio, full gun modification (vanilla and modded), custom sound, custom ammo, the Total Package!

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Localization:

This mod pack now has Localization Files. This means, that there will be descriptive text in the Information Windows. What ammo goes to what, would be the most prominent feature of Localization, but this has allowed me to properly redo this ENTIRE modlet. Now, if you just drag and drop like normal, all you will see is a bunch of mayicgunMrad, mayicgunChaingun. etc. 
RussianDood has created an amazing program, to take the hassle out of the complexity behind adding Localization for some of us out there. No one wants to do the leg work of copying one file, finding the original, pasting it, then updating it everytime TFP does. No, Thanks to RussianDood, we have this amazing program to do the leg work for us. Inside this Modlet, you will find a Localization.bat file. After you place the Modlet into the correct location, just simply run the bat file (double click), and hit Enter, Pick whatever option you'd like (I suggest 1), Enter, enter again, and we are DONE! Thats it. You will only need to do this again when the Modlet updates and you download a new version. Other then that, you are free to boot up completely as normal everytime! No need to constantly run the file before you boot the game. 
Thankyou RussianDood!

# Updating Existing Worlds with old versions of Firearms: 


It is entirely possible to play your OLD WORLD. The only thing you will lose, is your players current level and skills. Now, important steps if you are going to UPDATE the old Firearms Modlet:
- Remove ALL Firearms related assets (guns, ammo, targets) from your world. Despawn them, do not just put them in a chest.
- Remove all belongings to your character, put them in a secure place in your home
- Remove the old Firearms Modlet, place new one in your Mods folder
- Load back into the game. You will most likely be a fresh spawn out in the wild. No worries. Hit F1. Type 
- giveselfxp 10000
- hit enter.

This will give you 1 level. Each level is roughly 10-20% more xp (not sure on exact values) then the one before it. So level 2, would be around 22,000, rather then 20,000. Adjust accordingly to regain your old levels back. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known bugs:

- Animations run off a bool call (not using scripting). They are all on timers. Sometimes, skills such as faster reloads, might make the animation go fast or slow in accordance with hand movement. I attuned the speeds based on the guns "unlock" level. Finding a M98 early game, might show a slower animation. This will fix itself as you get near the appropriate level
- Audio might be too high, or too low. Currently in the process of adjusting levels. Feedback would be amazing. I am hard of hearing myself, too many guns IRL :P Nothing legally disabling me. Just god awful range in volume/pitch.
- Explosive Ammo has no physical graphical effect

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## How to install
 
- Navagate to your 7 Days to Die Directory (default: C:/ProgramFiles86/Steam/Steamapps/Common/7DaystoDie)
- Right click anywhere in your MAIN directory (not Data/Configs, not 7DaysToDie_Data), and create New Folder 
- Name New Folder: Mods [Our directory should look similar to something like this](https://imgur.com/a/pm5sJKc)
- Download entire mod pack via GitHub or other Trusted source (I only share via Discord, and GitHub. For my personal mods, do not trust any other source unless verified by me)
- Drag and Drop Firearms modlet into 7 Days To Die/Mods folder. [Our modlet named "Firearms" should show up under the mods directory like so](https://imgur.com/a/YtYmNW3)
- To confirm proper boot, upon loading into a map/server, press F1, and you should see our mod load with the following line: 
`2018-12-28T22:36:15 2.709 INF [MODS] Trying to load from Firearms`
`2018-12-28T22:36:15 2.709 INF [MODS] Loaded Mod: Firearms (1.0)`
